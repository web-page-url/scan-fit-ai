# 🚀 Project Prompt — **ScanFit: AI-Powered Job & Resume Matcher**

---

## 🧭 Overview

Build a **Next.js 16** web application named **ScanFit**, an AI-powered platform that intelligently compares **job descriptions** and **resumes**, providing deep analysis, ATS optimization insights, and actionable suggestions for improvement.

**ScanFit** helps users instantly understand how well their resume fits a job — highlighting missing keywords, formatting issues, and personalized rewrite suggestions to improve their chances of getting shortlisted.

The app should be:

* Visually **eye-catching** with a **cyber-themed, neon-dark design**
* Fully **mobile responsive**
* **Component-wise structured** for scalability and readability
* Integrated with the **Gemini API** for intelligent analysis

---

## 🧱 Core Features

### 1. Dual Input System

Users can provide:

* **Job Description** → via text area or upload (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`)
* **Resume** → via text area or upload (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`)

Each input should have:

* A toggle to switch between text input and file upload
* Drag-and-drop file upload with parsing preview
* Clear placeholders and examples

---

### 2. AI Analysis (Gemini API Integration)

After both inputs are provided, the **Gemini API** should:

* Parse and compare the job description and resume
* Generate a structured JSON response with:

  * `match_score` (0–100)
  * `missing_keywords` (skills or terms missing)
  * `strengths` (keywords that match)
  * `ats_recommendations` (improvements for ATS systems)
  * `rewrite_suggestions` (optimized lines or bullets)
  * `priority_actions` (ranked by impact)
  * `summary` (a natural language overview)
  * `confidence` (Low / Medium / High for each recommendation)

---

### 3. AI Output Report (Visually Engaging)

The **results screen** should display:

* **Overall Match Score** in a neon circular progress gauge
* **Top Strengths & Weaknesses** side-by-side
* **ATS Optimization Checklist** with ✅ / ⚠️ icons
* **Missing Keywords Section** (highlighted keywords)
* **Rewrite Suggestions Panel** with “Accept / Reject” buttons
* **Action Priority Board** — top 5 steps to boost score
* **Export Options** → Download improved resume (`PDF / DOCX`)

---

### 4. Cyber-Themed UI / UX Design

Visual direction:

* **Dark background**, **neon gradients** (electric blue, cyan, magenta, purple glows)
* **Glassmorphism cards** with glowing borders
* **Animated progress visuals** (e.g., scanning effect, radar sweep)
* Futuristic monospace typography for headings (`Orbitron`, `Space Grotesk`, etc.)
* Minimal motion effects → hover glows, gradient sweeps, and gentle fade-in transitions
* All elements must be mobile-friendly with touch support

---

## 🧩 Component Structure (Everything Component-Wise)

Each section of ScanFit should be built as a **dedicated reusable component**, such as:

## 🧠 AI Logic (Gemini Prompt Flow)

When the user clicks **“Analyze”**, the backend:

1. Parses both inputs → extracts text + sections (Experience, Skills, Education)
2. Builds a structured prompt to Gemini:

   * Compares resume vs job requirements
   * Identifies gaps and improvements
   * Outputs **strict JSON schema**
3. Validates Gemini’s response → returns clean JSON to frontend

Ensure the prompt is **schema-driven** and Gemini always outputs **valid JSON**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 UX Flow

1. User lands on ScanFit homepage → “Upload or Paste Job Description” + “Upload or Paste Resume” panels.
2. After both inputs are filled → “Scan & Fit” button activates.
3. On click → show **Scanning animation** (“Analyzing Resume & Job Match…”).
4. AI generates the report → visually displayed as modular cards.
5. User can interact with suggestions, accept changes, and download the optimized resume.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

* Resume & job data processed **temporarily only** (in-memory; not stored).
* Explicit note in footer: *“ScanFit does not save your data. All analyses are private and temporary.”*
* HTTPS enforced.
* Gemini API key stored securely in server environment variables.

---

**Top Strengths:** JavaScript, React, Next.js, REST APIs
**Missing Keywords:** TypeScript, CI/CD, Unit Testing
